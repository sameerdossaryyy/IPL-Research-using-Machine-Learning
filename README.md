# 🏏 IPL Research Using Machine Learning

This project explores the **behavioral patterns of right- and left-handed players** in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using **data analytics and machine learning**.  
By analyzing **1,000+ survey responses** and applying statistical models, the study identifies performance trends, inefficiencies, and actionable insights that can be applied to decision-making in cricket analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare right-handers vs left-handers based on survey data.
- Detect hidden patterns using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Apply **machine learning algorithms** to model and predict outcomes.
- Provide insights to reduce manual analysis work by ~20%.
